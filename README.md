# Boring Bubble Game

This is a simple bubble game made with SFML in C++. I created it just for fun and personal learning—there's nothing fancy here!

## How to Play
- Move the blue ball using the arrow keys.
- Try to touch the red square to score points.
- Your score is displayed at the top left.

## Requirements
- SFML 2.x
- C++17 or newer

## Build & Run
```
g++ -std=c++17 -g BubbleGame.cpp -o BubbleGame -I/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml@2/include -L/opt/homebrew/opt/sfml@2/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
./BubbleGame
```

## About
This project is just me having fun and practicing C++ and SFML. Enjoy, or feel free to ignore!
